# Code written during an Orion Aerospace 21 hour charity live stream
<b>TREAT THIS CODE AS EDUCATIONAL AND NOT FUNCTIONAL... this is not the full code written during the stream but it may help give direction</b>
This code was written during the last few hours of our stream so it is not perfect, but it might serve as a guide. Thanks to everyone who showed up we were able to raise almost $1,000 for St. Jude's Childrens hospital!!!! 
Big thank you to:
